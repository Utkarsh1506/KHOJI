# KHOJI - Ransomware Detection System

A web-based application to scan files for potential ransomware. This system calculates the Shannon entropy of uploaded files and uses a trained machine learning model to classify them as either safe or ransomware.

---

## Features
- üìÇ **File Scanning**: Upload a file to scan for ransomware.
- üîç **Entropy Analysis**: Calculates Shannon entropy to detect encryption patterns.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning**: Uses a trained Random Forest model for classification.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Mitigation Steps**: Provides logs and suggested actions if ransomware is detected.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for file uploads and scan results.

**Usage**
Follow these steps to scan a file:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the homepage in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a file using the "Choose File" button.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Click the "Scan" button to analyze the file.

4Ô∏è‚É£ View the results:

  Ransomware Detected: Displays logs, entropy value, and suggested mitigation steps.
  Safe: Indicates the file is not ransomware.
  
**Dependencies**
The project requires the following dependencies:

  Python 3.8 or higher
  Flask
  Joblib
  Scikit-learn
  Math library (built-in)
  Install all dependencies.

Training the ML Model
If the ransomware_detector.pkl file is missing, you can train the model with the following steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create or use an existing dataset
Generate or use a dataset containing entropy values and their respective labels (1 for ransomware, 0 for safe files).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the following script to train the model:
  import pandas as pd
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  import joblib
  
  # Example dataset
  data = {
      "entropy": [4.2, 5.7, 6.3, 1.8, 2.3, 7.1],
      "label": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  # 1 = Ransomware, 0 = Safe
  }
  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  
  X = df[["entropy"]]
  y = df["label"]
  
  # Train model
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  
  # Save model
  joblib.dump(model, "ml_model/ransomware_detector.pkl")
  print("Model trained and saved.")


3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the model
Save the trained model as ransomware_detector.pkl inside the ml_model directory.
